      'Burger works really well with Merlot, Malbec, and Zinfandel. Merlot will be perfectly adequate for a classic burger with standard toppings. Bolder toppings call for bolder wines, such as a malbec or peppery zinfandel. The Rasa Vineyards "Creative Impulse" DuBrul Vineyard Cab/Merlot Blend with a 4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 95 dollars per bottle.',

        description:
          "The 2010 Creative Impulse is a single vineyard wine. The grapes come from DuBrul Vineyard which we consider to be one of the best vineyards in the country. The 2010 Creative Impulse is a blend of 67.5% Cabernet Sauvignon and 32.5% Merlot from DuBrul Vineyard. Dark ruby in color with alluring aromatics of cassis, blackberry, mint, spice, smoke, and gravel. On the palate the wine is slightly firmer than the 2009 but it is just as concentrated and rich. It has a beautiful texture that displays firm yet silky tannins and amazing complexity. This gorgeous wine displays multifaceted layers of cassis, mint, violet, tobacco, smoke, earth, gravel, and gentle herbaceousness. The decadent finish is well over a minute long with resonant notes of earth, exotic spices, mint, and dark chocolate. This wine should reach maturity in 10-12 years, and properly cellared, this wine will gracefully evolve for 20+ years.",

Shape into 2 patties to fit the bun size. Loosely cover with plastic wrap and set aside.</li><li>For the fennel:</li><li>Grate 1/2 teaspoons zest from the lemons. Put the fennel rings in a medium-sized bowl (I used half a fennel bulb) and juice the lemon over half the fennel and toss to coat all the fennel rings. Add oil and season with salt. Put the fennel in a grill basket and grill, shaking the basket occasionally, until soft, 10 to 12 minutes. (I did this on the stove top) Transfer the fennel to a sheet of foil, sprinkle with the lemon zest, and wrap to keep warm.</li><li>Heat a large, heavy nonstick fire-proof skillet on the grill. Add the bacon and cook until crisp. Transfer to paper towels to drain. Wrap in foil to keep warm.</li><li>For the topping:</li><li>Drain off the bacon fat from the skillet, wipe out the skillet with paper towels, and set the skillet back on the grill. Add the walnuts to the skillet and toast until golden and fragrant; set aside.</li><li>Whisk the vinegar with the oil in a small bowl and season with salt, to taste. Combine the figs, arugula, and toasted walnuts in a medium bowl. Toss with just enough dressing to coat. (I like a tart vinaigrette so I use a 1:1 ratio for the oil and vinegar)</li><li>When the grill is ready, brush the grill rack with vegetable oil. Place the patties on the rack, cover, and cook, turning once, until done to preference, 5 to 7 minutes on each side for medium. Place the cheese slices on the patties during the last 3 minutes of grilling. Place the buns, cut side down, on the outer edges of the rack to toast lightly during the last 2 minutes of grilling.</li><li>To assemble the burgers, place equal portions of the warm grilled fennel on each bun bottom, followed by a cheese-topped patty, 2 bacon slices, and an equal portion of the fig-arugula topping. (I would use a lot of the fig topping) Add the bun tops and serve.</li></ol>",
